Poltava never feels this cold for him.

The wind slices through the cracked window of the safehouse like a scalpel, carrying the metallic tang of snow and distant diesel. The Nurse stands motionless in the dim bathroom, her gloved hands steady around the man's neck. His name was Viktor, or so the dossier claimed. Asset. Informant. Liability. Now just a body cooling against the chipped porcelain sink.

Behind her, the door creaks open—no knock, no warning. Cleo steps in, boots leaving faint wet prints on the tile. She's in civilian wool coat and scarf, but the way she moves is pure field: economical, predatory. Supervisor. Mentor. The woman who pulled Carmen from the field hospital rubble and remade her into this.
Cleo doesn't flinch at the scene. She never does. She simply tilts her head, studying the slumped form against the sink as if appraising a poorly executed watercolor.
"What should I say..." Cleo begins, voice soft, almost conversational, the Ukrainian accent smoothed by years of multilingual briefings. "I mean im not sure what to feel impressed first, the way his spit is foaming out of the mouth falling onto the sponge on the sink, making it look like a marble cake. Or the way you hold both of his carotids..."
She trails off, letting the words hang in the frigid air. It's not mockery. It's not praise. It's something colder: clinical observation, the same detached narration Carmen uses on herself in the mirror. Cleo has always mirrored her trainees' tics back at them—part teaching tool, part psychological mirror. A reminder that nothing is private, not even the private language of guilt.
Carmen doesn't turn. She keeps her eyes on the drain, watching the last pink swirl vanish.
"You were supposed to charm the drive out of him," Cleo continues, stepping closer. Her breath clouds faintly. "Not compress his carotids until the pulmonary edema paints the porcelain. This wasn't clean, Nurse."
"It wasn't supposed to be," Carmen replies, finally facing her. "He knew. He named me. Traitor. Monster. He had the Makarov out before I could blink."
Cleo's gaze flicks to the knife still sheathed at Carmen's hip, then to Viktor's empty hands. "And you chose pressure over the blade. Eleven pounds per artery, ten seconds to blackout. You counted, didn't you?"
Carmen nods once. "Four minutes past blackout. Brain death confirmed. Scene staged as overdose."
Cleo exhales through her nose—a sound that's almost a laugh, but without humor. "You always were thorough. That's why I picked you. Steady hands, no tremor. But this..." She gestures vaguely at the sink. "This is the part where the body betrays the mind. The foam. The marble cake. You notice the details because noticing keeps you from feeling them."
Cleo reaches past Carmen, shuts off the faucet with a gloved hand. The sudden silence is louder than the wind outside.
Poltava never feels this cold for him, Carmen thinks again. But Cleo stands there like the cold doesn't touch her at all. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe supervisors are built different—insulated by layers of deniability and dead assets.
"You want to know what I think?" Cleo asks, voice dropping lower. "I think you're still fighting the wrong war. Not against him. Not against the agency. Against the part of you that remembers stitching boys back together instead of taking them apart. That memory is what's making the cold settle in."
Carmen meets her eyes for the first time. Cleo's are pale green, unreadable as frost on glass.
"Then tell me how to stop feeling it," Carmen says. It's not a plea. It's a request for orders.
Cleo considers her for a long beat. Then she pulls a small burner phone from her coat pocket and places it on the sink's edge, next to the corpse's lolling head.
"You don't stop," she says quietly. "You redirect it. Next target is in Kharkiv. Leaves tomorrow. Same playbook: charm, extract, vanish. But this time, no deviations. No marble cake."
She turns toward the door, pausing with her hand on the knob.
"And Carmen?" Cleo's voice softens—just a fraction. "The next time you narrate your own kill to the mirror, don't whisper it like a confession. Say it louder. Own it. Because if you keep treating it like a secret shame, it'll eat you from the inside before any asset ever gets the chance."
The door opens. Cold rushes in, sharper now. Cleo steps through without looking back.
Carmen stands alone again, the burner phone vibrating faintly against the porcelain. A new mission. A new neck. Another set of carotids waiting for her steady hands.
She picks up the phone. The screen glows: coordinates, photo, dossier summary.
She exhales once, clouding the mirror.
Poltava never feels this cold for him.
But for her, the temperature keeps dropping.
And Cleo—her supervisor, her echo, her judge—has just reminded her why she can never stop falling.
Poltava was supposed to be routine. Extract intel from Viktor about troop movements near the border. Charm him, bed him if necessary, slip the encrypted drive from his coat while he slept. But Viktor had known. Or suspected. He'd come armed with a Makarov and questions she couldn't answer without breaking cover. The knife fight in the kitchen had been brief, ugly. She'd disarmed him, pinned him here, against this sink. One final interrogation. He spat names—hers among them. Traitor, he called her. Monster.








Now the foam on the sponge swirls pink at the edges, blood capillaries ruptured in the lungs. Marble cake. The image lodges in her mind like shrapnel she can't extract. She reaches for the faucet, lets cold water run over the mess, watching it dilute to pale rose before spiraling down the drain.

Outside, the city is quiet under its blanket of frost. Poltava in February: average low seventeen Fahrenheit, wind chill dropping it to single digits. But the cold she's feeling isn't meteorological. It's deeper, settling in the marrow like the first symptom of something terminal.

She thinks of her mother, back in Lviv, still believing her daughter works humanitarian aid in neutral zones. Thinks of the boy in the field hospital years ago, no older than eighteen, whose carotid she'd compressed to stop bleeding from a neck wound—saving him then, killing now. Same grip. Different intent. The body doesn't distinguish.

Carmen strips the gloves, disposes of them in a biohazard bag she'll burn later. She checks Viktor's pockets: phone, wallet, the drive. All accounted for. She arranges the scene—overdose, perhaps; needle marks already on his arms from years of habit. A plausible exit for a man who'd sold secrets to both sides.

But as she zips her coat and steps toward the door, the cold tightens its fist around her ribs. Not the wind. Not the temperature. It's the certainty that this won't be the last. The agency will call again. Another asset. Another neck. Another marble-cake moment she'll describe to herself in the mirror because no one else can hear it.

She pauses at the threshold, hand on the doorknob. For a second—just one—she imagines walking away. Disappearing into the snow like smoke. No more code names. No more pressure points.

Then she turns the knob.

Poltava never feels this cold for him.

But for her, it's only getting colder.

She steps into the night, the door clicking shut behind her like a final suture. The wind swallows her footsteps. Somewhere, a handler will receive the transmission: target neutralized. Mission complete.

The Nurse moves on.

Because that's what nurses do—they keep going, even when there's nothing left to save.
