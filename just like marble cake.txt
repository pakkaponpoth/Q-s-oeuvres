Poltava never feels this cold for him.

The wind slices through the cracked window of the safehouse like a scalpel, carrying the metallic tang of snow and distant diesel. The Nurse stands motionless in the dim bathroom, her gloved hands steady around the man's neck. His name was Viktor, or so the dossier claimed. Asset. Informant. Liability. Now just a body cooling against the chipped porcelain sink.

"What should I say..." she murmurs to the empty room, voice low, clinical, as if dictating notes for a patient chart that will never be filed. "I mean, impressed first is the way his spit is foaming out of the mouth a bit, falling onto the sponge on the sink, making it look like a marble cake. And the way she holds both of his carotids..."

She doesn't finish the sentence. There's no audience here, no debrief handler waiting on a secure line. Just her reflection in the fogged mirror—dark hair pinned severely, eyes the color of winter slate—and the slow, obscene trickle of saliva mixed with pulmonary edema froth bubbling past Viktor's slack lips. Eleven pounds of pressure per carotid, ten seconds to unconsciousness. She'd counted. Four minutes past that mark now. Brain death is polite; the body takes longer to accept the verdict.
Carmen releases her grip. The corpse slumps forward, forehead kissing the basin with a dull thud. She steps back, flexing her fingers inside the thin latex gloves. No tremor. Never a tremor. That's what they trained out of her first—hesitation, then emotion, then the illusion that any of this could still matter.

She was twenty-three when the agency recruited her from a field hospital in Donetsk. A real nurse once, stitching shrapnel wounds under artillery fire, whispering calm lies to boys who wouldn't see morning. They saw utility in her hands: steady, practiced at pressure points, familiar with veins and airways. They gave her a new name, a new purpose. The Nurse. Not for healing anymore.

Poltava was supposed to be routine. Extract intel from Viktor about troop movements near the border. Charm him, bed him if necessary, slip the encrypted drive from his coat while he slept. But Viktor had known. Or suspected. He'd come armed with a Makarov and questions she couldn't answer without breaking cover. The knife fight in the kitchen had been brief, ugly. She'd disarmed him, pinned him here, against this sink. One final interrogation. He spat names—hers among them. Traitor, he called her. Monster.

She'd pressed harder.

Now the foam on the sponge swirls pink at the edges, blood capillaries ruptured in the lungs. Marble cake. The image lodges in her mind like shrapnel she can't extract. She reaches for the faucet, lets cold water run over the mess, watching it dilute to pale rose before spiraling down the drain.

Outside, the city is quiet under its blanket of frost. Poltava in February: average low seventeen Fahrenheit, wind chill dropping it to single digits. But the cold she's feeling isn't meteorological. It's deeper, settling in the marrow like the first symptom of something terminal.

She thinks of her mother, back in Lviv, still believing her daughter works humanitarian aid in neutral zones. Thinks of the boy in the field hospital years ago, no older than eighteen, whose carotid she'd compressed to stop bleeding from a neck wound—saving him then, killing now. Same grip. Different intent. The body doesn't distinguish.

Carmen strips the gloves, disposes of them in a biohazard bag she'll burn later. She checks Viktor's pockets: phone, wallet, the drive. All accounted for. She arranges the scene—overdose, perhaps; needle marks already on his arms from years of habit. A plausible exit for a man who'd sold secrets to both sides.

But as she zips her coat and steps toward the door, the cold tightens its fist around her ribs. Not the wind. Not the temperature. It's the certainty that this won't be the last. The agency will call again. Another asset. Another neck. Another marble-cake moment she'll describe to herself in the mirror because no one else can hear it.

She pauses at the threshold, hand on the doorknob. For a second—just one—she imagines walking away. Disappearing into the snow like smoke. No more code names. No more pressure points.

Then she turns the knob.

Poltava never feels this cold for him.

But for her, it's only getting colder.

She steps into the night, the door clicking shut behind her like a final suture. The wind swallows her footsteps. Somewhere, a handler will receive the transmission: target neutralized. Mission complete.

The Nurse moves on.

Because that's what nurses do—they keep going, even when there's nothing left to save.
